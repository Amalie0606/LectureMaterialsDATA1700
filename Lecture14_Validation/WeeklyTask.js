/*
Goal: Build a full-stack CRUD application around a multi-table data model (PostgreSQL → Spring Boot → Bootstrap frontend) with validation.
- Continue with last week's or pick a new topic for your data/entities.
- Validate in the backend using @Pattern and @Valid.
- Validate the frontend using form attributes (including pattern)
- Use sessions to support a primitive authentication
- Implement artificial “login” by manually matching username and password to hardcoded values in the controller.
- All other endpoints must return 401 Unauthorized if the user is not logged in.
- Create a frontend login form that posts the username and password to the login endpoint.
- Implement Logout
(Make java classes)
